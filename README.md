PESK_Script
===========
The script is quite straight-forward. Make sure you make the script executable! You also will need to have the IP address of 
you server handy for the script!
Ex:
$chmod 755 PESK_install.sh
$./PESK_install.sh

The script will ask you for the IP address (you wrote it down right?) and then go off and do its thing!
